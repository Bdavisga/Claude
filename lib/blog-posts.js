      <p class="lead">Buying gold jewelry or coins? Before you invest your hard-earned money, you need to know if what you're getting is the real deal. Fake gold is more common than you might think, and the consequences of buying counterfeit pieces can be costly.</p>

      <p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through seven reliable methods to test gold authenticity, ranging from simple at-home tests to professional techniques.</p>

      <h2>1. The Magnet Test</h2>
      <p>One of the easiest tests you can perform. Real gold is not magnetic. If your piece sticks to a strong magnet, it's likely gold-plated steel or another metal entirely.</p>
      <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Use a strong neodymium magnet (regular fridge magnets aren't strong enough). Hold it close to your gold item. If there's any attraction, be suspicious.</p>
      <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Some fake gold uses non-magnetic metals like copper or brass, so this test alone isn't definitive.</p>

      <h2>2. The Hallmark Check</h2>
      <p>Legitimate gold jewelry should have a hallmark stamp indicating its purity. Look for markings like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>375</strong> - 9 karat (37.5% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>585</strong> - 14 karat (58.5% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>750</strong> - 18 karat (75% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>916</strong> - 22 karat (91.6% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>999</strong> - 24 karat (99.9% pure gold)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use a magnifying glass to find these stamps, usually located on clasps, inside rings, or on the back of pendants.</p>

      <h2>3. The Skin Test</h2>
      <p>Real gold doesn't react with skin or cause discoloration. If wearing a piece leaves green or black marks on your skin, the item is likely gold-plated over copper or brass.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some people's skin chemistry can cause reactions even with real gold, especially with lower karat pieces that contain more alloy metals.</p>

      <h2>4. The Float Test</h2>
      <p>Gold is extremely dense (19.3 g/cm³). Drop your piece into a cup of water:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real gold sinks immediately to the bottom</li>
        <li>Fake gold may float or sink slowly</li>
        <li>Gold-plated items often hover or sink at an angle</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. The Ceramic Scratch Test</h2>
      <p>Drag your gold piece across an unglazed ceramic plate or tile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real gold</strong> leaves a gold-colored streak</li>
        <li><strong>Fake gold</strong> leaves a black or gray streak</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Caution:</strong> This test can scratch your jewelry, so use it on inconspicuous areas.</p>

      <h2>6. The Nitric Acid Test</h2>
      <p>This is a more definitive test used by jewelers. Nitric acid doesn't react with pure gold but will cause other metals to dissolve or change color.</p>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Nitric acid is dangerous. This test should only be performed by professionals or with proper safety equipment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No reaction = Real gold</li>
        <li>Green reaction = Gold-plated or fake</li>
        <li>Milky reaction = Gold over silver</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Professional Electronic Testing</h2>
      <p>For the most accurate results, visit a professional jeweler who uses electronic gold testers. These devices measure electrical conductivity to determine gold purity instantly and non-destructively.</p>

      <h2>Using CalGeo for Valuation</h2>
      <p>Once you've verified your gold is authentic, use the CalGeo app to calculate its current market value. Our live spot prices and karat-specific calculations give you an accurate estimate of what your gold is worth today.</p>

      <h2>Red Flags When Buying Gold</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Price too good to be true</li>
        <li>Seller refuses to let you test the item</li>
        <li>No hallmarks or suspicious-looking stamps</li>
        <li>Inconsistent color or visible layers</li>
        <li>Unusually light weight</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While no single test is 100% foolproof, combining multiple methods gives you a reliable way to verify gold authenticity. When in doubt, always consult a professional jeweler or use certified testing services.</p>

      <p class="lead">When shopping for gold jewelry, you'll encounter terms like 10K, 14K, 18K, and 24K. But what do these numbers actually mean, and which should you choose? Understanding gold karats is essential for making informed purchasing decisions.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Karat?</h2>
      <p>Karat (K or kt) measures gold purity on a scale of 24 parts. Pure gold is 24 karats, meaning 24 out of 24 parts are gold. Lower karat numbers indicate gold mixed with other metals (alloys) like copper, silver, nickel, or zinc.</p>

      <p class="lead">Whether you're looking to sell inherited jewelry, declutter your collection, or simply curious about your gold's worth, understanding valuation is crucial. This guide breaks down exactly how gold jewelry is priced and what you can realistically expect to receive.</p>

      <h2>The Gold Valuation Formula</h2>
      <p>The base value of gold jewelry comes from a simple calculation:</p>
      <div class="formula-box">
        <strong>Melt Value = Weight (grams) × Purity (%) × Spot Price per gram</strong>
      </div>
      <p>For example, a 10-gram 14K gold chain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weight: 10 grams</li>
        <li>Purity: 58.3% (14K)</li>
        <li>Spot price: $85/gram (24K)</li>
        <li>Melt value: 10 × 0.583 × $85 = <strong>$495.55</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Spot Price</h2>
      <p>The spot price is the current market price for pure gold (24K) per troy ounce. It fluctuates constantly based on global markets. Key points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quoted per troy ounce (31.1 grams)</li>
        <li>Changes every few seconds during market hours</li>
        <li>Represents wholesale/bulk pricing</li>
        <li>Your jewelry's value is derived from this price</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use CalGeo to see today's live spot price and calculate your gold's current value instantly.</p>

      <h2>Melt Value vs. Retail Value</h2>
      <p>There's an important distinction between what gold is worth as raw material versus what it might sell for as jewelry:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Value Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Who Pays This</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Melt Value</td><td>Pure gold content value</td><td>Refiners, scrap buyers</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wholesale</td><td>Melt + small premium</td><td>Jewelers buying used</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Retail</td><td>Includes craftsmanship, brand, markup</td><td>Consumers buying new</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Antique/Collectible</td><td>Historical or artistic value</td><td>Collectors, auction houses</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>What Buyers Actually Pay</h2>
      <p>When selling gold jewelry, expect to receive less than melt value. Here's what different buyers typically pay:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pawn Shops:</strong> 40-60% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Cash for Gold stores:</strong> 50-70% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Online gold buyers:</strong> 70-85% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Local jewelers:</strong> 60-80% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Refiners (direct):</strong> 85-95% of melt value</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why the discount?</strong> Buyers need margin for refining costs, business overhead, and profit.</p>

      <h2>Factors That Affect Value</h2>
      <h3>Increases Value:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designer or brand name (Tiffany, Cartier)</li>
        <li>Antique or vintage pieces</li>
        <li>Unique craftsmanship</li>
        <li>Gemstones (evaluated separately)</li>
        <li>Complete sets or matching pieces</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Decreases Value:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage or repairs needed</li>
        <li>Missing stones</li>
        <li>Heavy wear or scratches</li>
        <li>Broken clasps or components</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Weigh Your Gold</h2>
      <p>Accurate weight is essential for valuation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a digital scale that measures in grams (0.1g precision minimum)</li>
        <li>Remove any non-gold components if possible</li>
        <li>Weigh pieces separately by karat</li>
        <li>Note: 1 troy ounce = 31.1 grams (not 28.35g like regular ounces)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Valuation Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify the karat</strong> - Look for stamps (10K, 14K, 18K, 585, 750)</li>
        <li><strong>Weigh the piece</strong> - Use a precise gram scale</li>
        <li><strong>Check spot price</strong> - Use CalGeo for live prices</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate melt value</strong> - Weight × Purity × Spot</li>
        <li><strong>Estimate payout</strong> - Apply buyer discount (70-85% typical)</li>
        <li><strong>Get multiple quotes</strong> - Always compare offers</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips for Getting the Best Price</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Know your numbers:</strong> Calculate melt value before negotiating</li>
        <li><strong>Shop around:</strong> Get at least 3 quotes</li>
        <li><strong>Sell direct:</strong> Online refiners often pay more than local shops</li>
        <li><strong>Time the market:</strong> Gold prices fluctuate - watch for highs</li>
        <li><strong>Separate by karat:</strong> Don't let buyers average down your higher karat pieces</li>
        <li><strong>Consider selling as jewelry:</strong> Designer pieces may fetch more than melt</li>
      </ul>
