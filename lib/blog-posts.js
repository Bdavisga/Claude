      <p class="lead">Buying gold jewelry or coins? Before you invest your hard-earned money, you need to know if what you're getting is the real deal. Fake gold is more common than you might think, and the consequences of buying counterfeit pieces can be costly.</p>

      <p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through seven reliable methods to test gold authenticity, ranging from simple at-home tests to professional techniques.</p>

      <h2>1. The Magnet Test</h2>
      <p>One of the easiest tests you can perform. Real gold is not magnetic. If your piece sticks to a strong magnet, it's likely gold-plated steel or another metal entirely.</p>
      <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Use a strong neodymium magnet (regular fridge magnets aren't strong enough). Hold it close to your gold item. If there's any attraction, be suspicious.</p>
      <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Some fake gold uses non-magnetic metals like copper or brass, so this test alone isn't definitive.</p>

      <h2>2. The Hallmark Check</h2>
      <p>Legitimate gold jewelry should have a hallmark stamp indicating its purity. Look for markings like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>375</strong> - 9 karat (37.5% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>585</strong> - 14 karat (58.5% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>750</strong> - 18 karat (75% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>916</strong> - 22 karat (91.6% gold)</li>
        <li><strong>999</strong> - 24 karat (99.9% pure gold)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use a magnifying glass to find these stamps, usually located on clasps, inside rings, or on the back of pendants.</p>

      <h2>3. The Skin Test</h2>
      <p>Real gold doesn't react with skin or cause discoloration. If wearing a piece leaves green or black marks on your skin, the item is likely gold-plated over copper or brass.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some people's skin chemistry can cause reactions even with real gold, especially with lower karat pieces that contain more alloy metals.</p>

      <h2>4. The Float Test</h2>
      <p>Gold is extremely dense (19.3 g/cm³). Drop your piece into a cup of water:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real gold sinks immediately to the bottom</li>
        <li>Fake gold may float or sink slowly</li>
        <li>Gold-plated items often hover or sink at an angle</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. The Ceramic Scratch Test</h2>
      <p>Drag your gold piece across an unglazed ceramic plate or tile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real gold</strong> leaves a gold-colored streak</li>
        <li><strong>Fake gold</strong> leaves a black or gray streak</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Caution:</strong> This test can scratch your jewelry, so use it on inconspicuous areas.</p>

      <h2>6. The Nitric Acid Test</h2>
      <p>This is a more definitive test used by jewelers. Nitric acid doesn't react with pure gold but will cause other metals to dissolve or change color.</p>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Nitric acid is dangerous. This test should only be performed by professionals or with proper safety equipment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No reaction = Real gold</li>
        <li>Green reaction = Gold-plated or fake</li>
        <li>Milky reaction = Gold over silver</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Professional Electronic Testing</h2>
      <p>For the most accurate results, visit a professional jeweler who uses electronic gold testers. These devices measure electrical conductivity to determine gold purity instantly and non-destructively.</p>

      <h2>Using CalGeo for Valuation</h2>
      <p>Once you've verified your gold is authentic, use the CalGeo app to calculate its current market value. Our live spot prices and karat-specific calculations give you an accurate estimate of what your gold is worth today.</p>

      <h2>Red Flags When Buying Gold</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Price too good to be true</li>
        <li>Seller refuses to let you test the item</li>
        <li>No hallmarks or suspicious-looking stamps</li>
        <li>Inconsistent color or visible layers</li>
        <li>Unusually light weight</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While no single test is 100% foolproof, combining multiple methods gives you a reliable way to verify gold authenticity. When in doubt, always consult a professional jeweler or use certified testing services.</p>

      <p class="lead">When shopping for gold jewelry, you'll encounter terms like 10K, 14K, 18K, and 24K. But what do these numbers actually mean, and which should you choose? Understanding gold karats is essential for making informed purchasing decisions.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Karat?</h2>
      <p>Karat (K or kt) measures gold purity on a scale of 24 parts. Pure gold is 24 karats, meaning 24 out of 24 parts are gold. Lower karat numbers indicate gold mixed with other metals (alloys) like copper, silver, nickel, or zinc.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Quick Reference:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>24K = 99.9% pure gold</li>

      <p class="lead">Whether you're looking to sell inherited jewelry, declutter your collection, or simply curious about your gold's worth, understanding valuation is crucial. This guide breaks down exactly how gold jewelry is priced and what you can realistically expect to receive.</p>

      <h2>The Gold Valuation Formula</h2>
      <p>The base value of gold jewelry comes from a simple calculation:</p>
      <div class="formula-box">
        <strong>Melt Value = Weight (grams) × Purity (%) × Spot Price per gram</strong>
      </div>
      <p>For example, a 10-gram 14K gold chain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weight: 10 grams</li>
        <li>Purity: 58.3% (14K)</li>
        <li>Spot price: $85/gram (24K)</li>
        <li>Melt value: 10 × 0.583 × $85 = <strong>$495.55</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Spot Price</h2>
      <p>The spot price is the current market price for pure gold (24K) per troy ounce. It fluctuates constantly based on global markets. Key points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quoted per troy ounce (31.1 grams)</li>
        <li>Changes every few seconds during market hours</li>
        <li>Represents wholesale/bulk pricing</li>
        <li>Your jewelry's value is derived from this price</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use CalGeo to see today's live spot price and calculate your gold's current value instantly.</p>

      <h2>Melt Value vs. Retail Value</h2>
      <p>There's an important distinction between what gold is worth as raw material versus what it might sell for as jewelry:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Value Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Who Pays This</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Melt Value</td><td>Pure gold content value</td><td>Refiners, scrap buyers</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wholesale</td><td>Melt + small premium</td><td>Jewelers buying used</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Retail</td><td>Includes craftsmanship, brand, markup</td><td>Consumers buying new</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Antique/Collectible</td><td>Historical or artistic value</td><td>Collectors, auction houses</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>What Buyers Actually Pay</h2>
      <p>When selling gold jewelry, expect to receive less than melt value. Here's what different buyers typically pay:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pawn Shops:</strong> 40-60% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Cash for Gold stores:</strong> 50-70% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Online gold buyers:</strong> 70-85% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Local jewelers:</strong> 60-80% of melt value</li>
        <li><strong>Refiners (direct):</strong> 85-95% of melt value</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why the discount?</strong> Buyers need margin for refining costs, business overhead, and profit.</p>

      <h2>Factors That Affect Value</h2>
      <h3>Increases Value:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designer or brand name (Tiffany, Cartier)</li>
        <li>Antique or vintage pieces</li>
        <li>Unique craftsmanship</li>
        <li>Gemstones (evaluated separately)</li>
        <li>Complete sets or matching pieces</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Decreases Value:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage or repairs needed</li>
        <li>Missing stones</li>
        <li>Heavy wear or scratches</li>
        <li>Broken clasps or components</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Weigh Your Gold</h2>
      <p>Accurate weight is essential for valuation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a digital scale that measures in grams (0.1g precision minimum)</li>
        <li>Remove any non-gold components if possible</li>
        <li>Weigh pieces separately by karat</li>
        <li>Note: 1 troy ounce = 31.1 grams (not 28.35g like regular ounces)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Valuation Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify the karat</strong> - Look for stamps (10K, 14K, 18K, 585, 750)</li>
        <li><strong>Weigh the piece</strong> - Use a precise gram scale</li>
        <li><strong>Check spot price</strong> - Use CalGeo for live prices</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate melt value</strong> - Weight × Purity × Spot</li>
        <li><strong>Estimate payout</strong> - Apply buyer discount (70-85% typical)</li>
        <li><strong>Get multiple quotes</strong> - Always compare offers</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips for Getting the Best Price</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Know your numbers:</strong> Calculate melt value before negotiating</li>
        <li><strong>Shop around:</strong> Get at least 3 quotes</li>
        <li><strong>Sell direct:</strong> Online refiners often pay more than local shops</li>
        <li><strong>Time the market:</strong> Gold prices fluctuate - watch for highs</li>
        <li><strong>Separate by karat:</strong> Don't let buyers average down your higher karat pieces</li>
        <li><strong>Consider selling as jewelry:</strong> Designer pieces may fetch more than melt</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <p class="lead">Gold has shattered records in 2026, trading above $4,500 per ounce and reaching an all-time high of $4,642 in January. If you own gold jewelry or are considering buying, understanding this historic rally is essential for making smart decisions.</p>

      <h2>Current Gold Prices (January 2026)</h2>
      <p>As of mid-January 2026:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spot Price:</strong> ~$4,595 per troy ounce</li>
        <li><strong>Per Gram (24K):</strong> ~$148</li>

        <li><strong>Year-Over-Year Gain:</strong> Nearly 50%</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Driving the Gold Rally?</h2>
      <p>Analysts point to three major factors—often called "the three horsemen":</p>

      <h3>1. Persistent Inflation</h3>
      <p>Despite central bank efforts, inflation remains sticky globally. Gold has historically been the go-to hedge against currency devaluation, and investors are piling in.</p>

      <h3>2. Central Bank Buying</h3>
      <p>For the first time since 1996, gold now accounts for a larger share of central bank reserves than U.S. Treasuries. Central banks are buying approximately 585 tonnes per quarter in 2026.</p>

      <h3>3. Skyrocketing Global Debt</h3>
      <p>Government debt levels worldwide have reached unprecedented heights, making hard assets like gold increasingly attractive as a store of value.</p>

      <h2>Expert Forecasts for 2026</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Institution</th><th>2026 Forecast</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Morgan Stanley</td><td>$4,400/oz (revised up from $3,313)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>J.P. Morgan</td><td>$5,000/oz by Q4 2026</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Long Forecast</td><td>$6,865 - $7,656/oz by December</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Bank Consensus</td><td>$4,500 - $4,700/oz average</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Some analysts see potential for $6,000/oz if macro conditions remain favorable.</p>

      <h2>Should You Sell Your Gold Now?</h2>
      <p>With prices at all-time highs, many are wondering if now is the time to cash in. Consider:</p>

      <h3>Reasons to Sell:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lock in record-high prices</li>
        <li>Jewelry you don't wear is "dead money"</li>
        <li>Prices could correct if interest rates rise</li>
        <li>You need the cash for other investments</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reasons to Hold:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Forecasts suggest further upside</li>
        <li>Inflation hedge still relevant</li>
        <li>Central bank demand remains strong</li>
        <li>Geopolitical uncertainty supports prices</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Potential Headwinds</h2>
      <p>Despite the bullish outlook, be aware of risks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overbought conditions (most overbought since 1980)</li>
        <li>Potential for profit-taking corrections</li>
        <li>Strong U.S. dollar could cap gains</li>
        <li>Jewelry demand already weakening due to high prices</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What This Means for Your Jewelry</h2>
      <p>If you have gold jewelry, its melt value has increased dramatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 10g 14K chain worth $350 in 2024 is now worth ~$860</li>
        <li>A 20g 18K bracelet worth $900 in 2024 is now worth ~$2,220</li>
        <li>Even 10K pieces have significant value at these prices</li>

      <p class="lead">What started as a Reddit meme in 2021 has become a full-blown supply crisis in 2026. Silver has posted a staggering 180% gain over the past twelve months, and analysts are calling it "the perfect storm." Here's everything you need to know.</p>

      <h2>Origins: The Reddit Movement</h2>
      <p>The Silver Squeeze movement began in early 2021 on Reddit—the same platform that sent GameStop soaring. Retail investors on r/WallStreetBets and later r/WallStreetSilver (which grew to 269,000+ members) attempted to squeeze silver prices through coordinated physical buying.</p>
      <p>While the 2021 attempt fizzled, it planted seeds that would bloom into something much bigger.</p>

      <h2>2026: A Real Supply Crisis</h2>
      <p>Unlike the retail-driven movement of years past, the 2026 squeeze is characterized by a genuine physical deficit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2025 Demand:</strong> ~1.24 billion ounces</li>
        <li><strong>2025 Supply:</strong> ~1.01 billion ounces</li>
        <li><strong>Deficit:</strong> 200+ million ounces (equivalent to the world's largest producing country)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>China's Export Restrictions</h2>
      <p>Starting January 1, 2026, China imposed new restrictions on silver exports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only large, state-approved producers can export refined silver</li>
        <li>Government licenses now required</li>
        <li>Minimum 80 tonnes annual production capacity required</li>
        <li>Verified credit facilities exceeding $30 million needed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This has further tightened an already constrained market.</p>

      <h2>Why Silver Supply Can't Keep Up</h2>
      <p>Unlike gold, silver faces unique supply challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most silver is a byproduct of copper, zinc, and lead mining</li>
        <li>Higher silver prices alone don't quickly increase output</li>
        <li>New mining projects take 8-12 years to come online</li>
        <li>Ore grades continue to decline globally</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Price Forecasts</h2>
      <p>Major institutions are making bold predictions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Citigroup:</strong> $100/oz by March 2026, potentially $110/oz by H2</li>
        <li><strong>Current Price:</strong> Already showing 180% annual gains</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Demand:</strong> EVs, solar panels, and satellites all require silver</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When Elon Musk publicly admitted the silver price surge is "not good" for Tesla's battery production, it confirmed the squeeze had moved from theory to manufacturing crisis.</p>

      <h2>What This Means for Silver Jewelry Owners</h2>
      <p>If you own silver jewelry or sterling silver items, their value has increased significantly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sterling silver (92.5% pure) is worth more than ever</li>
        <li>Even silver-plated items with solid silver components have value</li>
        <li>Old silverware, coins, and jewelry are worth reassessing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Should You Buy Silver Now?</h2>
      <h3>Bull Case:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Supply deficit is structural, not temporary</li>
        <li>Industrial demand (EVs, solar) only growing</li>
        <li>Gold-to-silver ratio historically suggests silver is undervalued</li>
        <li>$100/oz predictions from major banks</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Bear Case:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rapid price increases often lead to corrections</li>
        <li>Recession could dampen industrial demand</li>
        <li>Substitution effects may reduce silver usage</li>
      </ul>

    tags: ['jade', 'authenticity', 'testing', 'jewelry'],
    content: `
      <p class="lead">The jade market is flooded with fakes. From glass imitations to dyed low-grade stones, distinguishing real jade from imposters requires knowledge. This guide teaches you six tests to authenticate jade before you buy.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Jade Types</h2>
      <p>First, know that "jade" refers to two different minerals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jadeite:</strong> Rarer, harder, more valuable. Comes in green, lavender, yellow, white. Imperial jade (vivid green jadeite from Myanmar) is the most prized.</li>
        <li><strong>Nephrite:</strong> More common, slightly softer, usually green to gray-green. Still genuine jade, just less valuable than jadeite.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Jade Grading System</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grade A:</strong> Natural, untreated jade (most valuable)</li>
        <li><strong>Grade B:</strong> Bleached and polymer-impregnated</li>
        <li><strong>Grade C:</strong> Dyed jade</li>
        <li><strong>Grade B+C:</strong> Both treated and dyed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only Grade A jade holds significant value. Treatments dramatically reduce worth.</p>

      <h2>Test 1: The Temperature Test</h2>
      <p>Real jade stays cool to the touch, even when held.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hold the piece in your palm for 30-60 seconds</li>
        <li>Real jade: Remains cool, warms slowly</li>
        <li>Fake (glass/resin): Warms quickly to body temperature</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This works because jade is dense and conducts heat slowly.</p>

      <h2>Test 2: The Sound Test</h2>
      <p>Authentic jade produces a distinctive sound when tapped.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gently tap the jade with a metal object or another piece of jade</li>
        <li>Real jade: Clear, bell-like, resonant tone</li>
        <li>Fake jade: Dull, plastic-like thud</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Test 3: The Density Test</h2>
      <p>Jade is surprisingly heavy for its size.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toss it gently in your hand—it should feel substantial</li>
        <li>Real jade: Dense, solid, heavier than expected</li>
        <li>Glass/plastic fakes: Often lighter than genuine jade</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Test 4: The Scratch Test</h2>
      <p>Jade ranks 6-7 on the Mohs hardness scale (steel is 5).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try scratching an inconspicuous area with a steel knife</li>
        <li>Real jade: Should not scratch (it's harder than steel)</li>
        <li>Fake jade: May show scratch marks</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Don't do this on valuable pieces—use other tests first.</p>

      <h2>Test 5: The Light Test</h2>
      <p>Hold the jade up to a bright light source:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real jade: Fibrous, granular internal structure visible. Color consistent with minor natural variations.</li>
        <li>Fake jade: May show bubbles (glass), perfect uniformity (dyed), or layers (composite).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A 10x loupe helps you see the internal structure more clearly.</p>

      <h2>Test 6: Visual Inspection</h2>
      <p>Examine the piece carefully for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Natural jade has subtle variations. Too-perfect color suggests dye.</li>
        <li><strong>Surface:</strong> Real jade has a smooth, waxy luster. Glass is more glassy/shiny.</li>
        <li><strong>Imperfections:</strong> Some natural inclusions are normal. Perfect clarity is suspicious.</li>
        <li><strong>Dye concentration:</strong> Check cracks and crevices—dye often pools there.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What These Tests Can't Tell You</h2>
      <p>Important limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cannot distinguish jadeite from nephrite</li>
        <li>Cannot detect bleaching or polymer treatment (Grade B)</li>
        <li>Cannot determine exact origin (Burmese vs. other)</li>
        <li>Cannot provide precise value</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Get Professional Testing</h2>
      <p>For high-value pieces, seek professional authentication:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>GIA (Gemological Institute of America) certification</li>
        <li>Infrared spectroscopy for treatment detection</li>
        <li>Professional appraisal for imperial jade</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Value Factors for Real Jade</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Vivid, even emerald green (imperial) is most valuable</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> "Jelly-like" transparency worth more than opaque</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Smooth, fine-grained preferred</li>
        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Larger pieces command premiums</li>
        <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Myanmar (Burma) jadeite most prized</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead">Gold prices have surged to all-time highs in 2026, leaving many jewelry owners wondering: should I sell now, or could prices go higher? Let's analyze the market to help you make an informed decision.</p>

      <h2>Current Market Snapshot</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Current Price:</strong> ~$4,500-4,600/oz</li>
        <li><strong>All-Time High:</strong> $4,642/oz (January 2026)</li>
        <li><strong>2025 Performance:</strong> Nearly 50% gain</li>
        <li><strong>5-Year Return:</strong> Over 150%</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Arguments for Selling Now</h2>
      <h3>1. Lock in Record Prices</h3>
      <p>Gold has never been worth more. Your jewelry's melt value has likely doubled in the past 2-3 years. Selling now guarantees these gains.</p>

      <h3>2. Overbought Conditions</h3>
      <p>Technical indicators show gold at its most overbought since 1980. The monthly RSI is at extreme levels, historically preceding corrections.</p>

      <h3>3. Jewelry You Don't Wear</h3>
      <p>Unworn jewelry is "dead money." At record prices, converting it to cash or investments makes financial sense.</p>

      <h3>4. Potential Headwinds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong dollar could cap gains</li>
        <li>Interest rate surprises</li>
        <li>Profit-taking could trigger pullback</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Arguments for Waiting</h2>
      <h3>1. Bullish Expert Forecasts</h3>
      <p>Major institutions see more upside:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>J.P. Morgan: $5,000/oz by Q4 2026</li>
        <li>Some analysts: $6,000/oz possible</li>
        <li>Long-term forecasts even higher</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Structural Demand</h3>
      <p>Central banks continue buying aggressively. Gold now exceeds U.S. Treasuries in central bank reserves for the first time since 1996.</p>

      <h3>3. Inflation Hedge</h3>
      <p>If inflation persists, gold typically benefits. Holding gold protects purchasing power.</p>

      <h3>4. Geopolitical Uncertainty</h3>
      <p>Global tensions support safe-haven demand. Uncertainty typically pushes gold higher.</p>

      <h2>A Balanced Approach</h2>
      <p>Consider these strategies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sell partial holdings:</strong> Lock in some gains while maintaining exposure</li>
        <li><strong>Sell unworn jewelry:</strong> Keep pieces you love, sell what sits in a drawer</li>
        <li><strong>Set a target:</strong> Decide on a price that would trigger your sale</li>
        <li><strong>Dollar-cost averaging out:</strong> Sell portions over time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
      <p>What your jewelry might be worth now vs. 2 years ago:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Item</th><th>2024 Value</th><th>2026 Value</th><th>Gain</th></tr>
        <tr><td>10g 14K ring</td><td>~$350</td><td>~$850</td><td>+$500</td></tr>
        <tr><td>25g 18K bracelet</td><td>~$1,125</td><td>~$2,720</td><td>+$1,595</td></tr>
        <tr><td>50g 14K chain</td><td>~$1,750</td><td>~$4,250</td><td>+$2,500</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Key Questions to Ask Yourself</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Do I need the money now?</li>
        <li>Am I comfortable with the risk of prices dropping?</li>
        <li>Do I have sentimental attachment to these pieces?</li>
        <li>What would I do with the proceeds?</li>
        <li>Can I live with regret if prices go higher?</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>There's no perfect answer. Selling at all-time highs is rarely a bad decision. But if experts are right, waiting could yield more. Consider your personal circumstances, not just the market.</p>

    content: `
      <p class="lead">Both gold and silver have delivered exceptional returns recently, but they're very different investments. In 2026's unique market, which precious metal deserves your money? Let's break it down.</p>

      <h2>2026 Performance Snapshot</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Metal</th><th>Current Price</th><th>12-Month Return</th><th>All-Time High</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Gold</td><td>~$4,500/oz</td><td>~50%</td><td>$4,642 (Jan 2026)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Silver</td><td>~$50+/oz</td><td>~180%</td><td>Testing new highs</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>The Case for Gold</h2>
      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Store of value:</strong> 5,000+ years of monetary history</li>
        <li><strong>Central bank demand:</strong> Record buying continues</li>
        <li><strong>Lower volatility:</strong> More stable than silver</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation hedge:</strong> Proven protection against currency debasement</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Easier to buy/sell large amounts</li>
        <li><strong>No industrial risk:</strong> Value doesn't depend on economic growth</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Concerns:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Already at all-time highs</li>
        <li>Overbought technical conditions</li>
        <li>Jewelry demand weakening due to high prices</li>
        <li>Less upside potential percentage-wise</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Case for Silver</h2>
      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Industrial demand:</strong> EVs, solar panels, electronics all need silver</li>
        <li><strong>Supply deficit:</strong> 200+ million oz shortfall</li>
        <li><strong>China restrictions:</strong> New export limits tighten supply</li>
        <li><strong>Higher upside:</strong> Gold/silver ratio suggests undervaluation</li>
        <li><strong>More affordable:</strong> Easier entry point for small investors</li>
        <li><strong>$100/oz forecasts:</strong> Citigroup sees significant upside</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Concerns:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Much more volatile than gold</li>
        <li>Industrial demand falls in recessions</li>
        <li>Bulkier to store per dollar of value</li>
        <li>Already up 180%—is the easy money made?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Gold/Silver Ratio Analysis</h2>
      <p>The gold/silver ratio measures how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Historical average:</strong> ~60:1</li>
        <li><strong>Current ratio:</strong> ~90:1</li>
        <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Silver is historically cheap vs gold</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the ratio normalizes, silver could significantly outperform gold.</p>

      <h2>Investment Vehicles Compared</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Vehicle</th><th>Gold</th><th>Silver</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Physical coins/bars</td><td>Lower premiums</td><td>Higher premiums over spot</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ETFs</td><td>GLD, IAU (very liquid)</td><td>SLV (liquid)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Mining stocks</td><td>Leverage to gold price</td><td>Leverage + industrial exposure</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Jewelry</td><td>Stores well, high resale</td><td>Lower resale value</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Risk Comparison</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Silver is 2-3x more volatile than gold</li>
        <li><strong>Drawdowns:</strong> Silver crashes harder in bear markets</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> $100K of silver weighs ~125 lbs vs ~1.5 lbs for gold</li>
        <li><strong>Counterparty:</strong> Physical metal = no counterparty risk</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who Should Buy Gold?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Conservative investors seeking wealth preservation</li>
        <li>Those wanting lower volatility</li>
        <li>Large allocations (easier to store/transport)</li>
        <li>Investors prioritizing liquidity</li>
        <li>Portfolio hedge against stocks/bonds</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who Should Buy Silver?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Aggressive investors seeking higher returns</li>
        <li>Those comfortable with volatility</li>
        <li>Smaller investment amounts</li>
        <li>Believers in green energy/EV growth</li>
        <li>Speculators on industrial demand</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A Balanced Approach</h2>
      <p>Many investors hold both:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>75% Gold / 25% Silver:</strong> Conservative, stability-focused</li>
        <li><strong>50% Gold / 50% Silver:</strong> Balanced exposure</li>
        <li><strong>25% Gold / 75% Silver:</strong> Aggressive, high-upside focus</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gold:</strong> Safer, more stable, proven store of value</li>
        <li><strong>Silver:</strong> Higher risk, higher potential reward, industrial kicker</li>
        <li><strong>Both:</strong> Diversification benefits, hedge against fiat currency</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead">Inheriting jewelry brings both opportunity and emotional complexity. Whether you've received a small ring or an extensive collection, this guide helps you navigate valuation, selling, and the sensitive aspects of parting with family pieces.</p>

      <h2>First Steps After Inheriting Jewelry</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Don't rush:</strong> Take time to process emotions before making decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Photograph each piece thoroughly</li>
        <li><strong>Secure storage:</strong> Use a safe or safety deposit box</li>
        <li><strong>Check for appraisals:</strong> Look for existing documentation</li>
        <li><strong>Review the will:</strong> Ensure pieces weren't designated for specific heirs</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Getting Jewelry Appraised</h2>
      <h3>Types of Appraisals:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Insurance appraisal:</strong> Replacement value (highest)</li>
        <li><strong>Fair market value:</strong> What a willing buyer would pay</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidation value:</strong> Quick-sale price (lowest)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For selling, you want fair market or liquidation value—insurance appraisals overstate what buyers will pay.</p>

      <h3>Where to Get Appraised:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Certified gemologists (GIA, AGS)</li>
        <li>Estate jewelry specialists</li>
        <li>Auction house evaluations (often free)</li>
        <li>Independent appraisers (not buyers)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Never rely solely on a buyer's appraisal—they have incentive to lowball.</p>

      <h2>Understanding What You Have</h2>
      <h3>Check for Hallmarks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>10K, 14K, 18K, 24K:</strong> Gold karat</li>
        <li><strong>585, 750, 916, 999:</strong> European gold purity marks</li>
        <li><strong>925, Sterling:</strong> Sterling silver</li>
        <li><strong>Plat, PT:</strong> Platinum</li>
        <li><strong>GF, RGP:</strong> Gold-filled (not solid gold)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Identify Valuable Pieces:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Signed designer pieces (Tiffany, Cartier, Van Cleef)</li>
        <li>Antique or vintage (pre-1950)</li>
        <li>Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Victorian styles</li>
        <li>High-quality gemstones with certificates</li>
        <li>Complete sets (necklace + earrings + bracelet)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tax Implications</h2>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stepped-up basis:</strong> Your cost basis is the value at date of death, not original purchase price</li>
        <li><strong>Capital gains:</strong> You only owe tax on gains above the inherited value</li>
        <li><strong>Collectibles rate:</strong> Jewelry may be taxed at 28% collectibles rate (vs lower long-term capital gains)</li>
        <li><strong>Estate tax:</strong> Already paid by estate if applicable; you don't pay again</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where to Sell Inherited Jewelry</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Option</th><th>Best For</th><th>Expected Return</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Auction houses</td><td>Designer, antique, high-value</td><td>Highest for special pieces</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Estate jewelers</td><td>Quality pieces with craftsmanship</td><td>70-85% of retail</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Online gold buyers</td><td>Plain gold, scrap</td><td>70-85% of melt</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Consignment</td><td>Designer pieces</td><td>60-70% after commission</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Pawn shops</td><td>Quick cash needs</td><td>40-60% of melt</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Selling Strategy by Piece Type</h2>
      <h3>Plain Gold Jewelry:</h3>
      <p>Calculate melt value, sell to highest-paying gold buyer. At 2026's record prices, even simple pieces have significant value.</p>

      <h3>Designer/Signed Pieces:</h3>
      <p>Worth more than melt. Try auction houses or specialist dealers who can get brand premium.</p>

      <h3>Antique/Vintage:</h3>
      <p>May have collector value beyond materials. Get specialty appraisal before selling as scrap.</p>

      <h3>Gemstone Jewelry:</h3>
      <p>Stones valued separately from metal. Quality diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds add significant value.</p>

      <h2>Handling Sentimental Pieces</h2>
      <p>Not everything should be sold. Consider:</p>
      <ul>

      <p class="lead">The 4Cs—Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat—are the universal standard for evaluating diamond quality and value. Understanding how each factor contributes to price helps you make smarter buying and selling decisions.</p>

      <h2>The 4Cs at a Glance</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Factor</th><th>What It Measures</th><th>Impact on Price</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Cut</td><td>How well the diamond reflects light</td><td>Highest impact on beauty</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Color</td><td>Absence of color (whiteness)</td><td>High impact</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Clarity</td><td>Absence of inclusions/blemishes</td><td>Moderate impact</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Carat</td><td>Weight (size)</td><td>Highest impact on price</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Cut: The Most Important C</h2>
      <p>Cut determines how brilliantly a diamond sparkles. Even a flawless, colorless diamond looks dull with a poor cut.</p>

      <h3>GIA Cut Grades:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Excellent:</strong> Maximum brilliance, fire, and scintillation</li>
        <li><strong>Very Good:</strong> Exceptional quality, slightly less ideal proportions</li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> Reflects most light, good value</li>
        <li><strong>Fair:</strong> Reasonable brilliance, budget option</li>
        <li><strong>Poor:</strong> Little brilliance, not recommended</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cut Elements:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proportions:</strong> Table size, crown angle, pavilion depth</li>
        <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> How precisely facets align</li>
        <li><strong>Polish:</strong> Smoothness of facet surfaces</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Never compromise on cut. An Excellent or Very Good cut makes smaller, lower-color diamonds look stunning.</p>

      <h2>Color: The Whiteness Factor</h2>
      <p>Diamond color actually measures the absence of color. Most diamonds have slight yellow or brown tints.</p>

      <h3>GIA Color Scale:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>D-E-F:</strong> Colorless (most valuable)</li>
        <li><strong>G-H-I-J:</strong> Near colorless (excellent value)</li>
        <li><strong>K-L-M:</strong> Faint yellow</li>
        <li><strong>N-Z:</strong> Light yellow to yellow</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> G-H color offers the best value. The difference from D-F is invisible to most eyes, especially once set in jewelry.</p>

      <h2>Clarity: Internal Perfection</h2>
      <p>Clarity measures tiny imperfections (inclusions) inside the diamond.</p>

      <h3>GIA Clarity Scale:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FL (Flawless):</strong> No inclusions at 10x magnification</li>
        <li><strong>IF (Internally Flawless):</strong> No internal inclusions</li>
        <li><strong>VVS1-VVS2:</strong> Very, very slightly included</li>
        <li><strong>VS1-VS2:</strong> Very slightly included</li>
        <li><strong>SI1-SI2:</strong> Slightly included</li>
        <li><strong>I1-I2-I3:</strong> Included (visible to naked eye)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> VS2 or SI1 offers best value. Inclusions are invisible without magnification, saving significant money.</p>

      <h2>Carat: Size Matters</h2>
      <p>Carat measures weight, not physical size (though they correlate). One carat = 200 milligrams.</p>

      <h3>Price Jump Points:</h3>
      <p>Prices increase dramatically at certain weights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>0.50 carat</li>
        <li>0.75 carat</li>
        <li>1.00 carat (biggest jump)</li>
        <li>1.50 carat</li>
        <li>2.00 carat</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Smart Buy:</strong> A 0.95-carat diamond looks virtually identical to 1.00 carat but costs significantly less.</p>

      <h2>How the 4Cs Affect Price</h2>
      <p>Example: How price changes for a 1-carat round diamond:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Specs</th><th>Approximate Price</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Excellent Cut, D, IF</td><td>$15,000+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Excellent Cut, G, VS2</td><td>$6,000-8,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Very Good Cut, H, SI1</td><td>$4,000-5,500</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Good Cut, J, SI2</td><td>$2,500-3,500</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Best Value Strategy</h2>
      <p>Maximize appearance while minimizing cost:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prioritize Cut:</strong> Excellent or Very Good only</li>
        <li><strong>Go Near Colorless:</strong> G-H color sweet spot</li>
        <li><strong>Eye-Clean Clarity:</strong> VS2 or SI1</li>
        <li><strong>Buy Below Magic Numbers:</strong> 0.90 instead of 1.00 carat</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Certification Matters</h2>
      <p>Only buy certified diamonds from reputable labs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GIA:</strong> Gemological Institute of America (gold standard)</li>
        <li><strong>AGS:</strong> American Gem Society (excellent for cut)</li>
        <li><strong>IGI:</strong> International Gemological Institute (good, slightly lenient)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Avoid: In-house certifications, unknown labs, or uncertified stones.</p>

      <h2>Lab-Grown vs. Natural</h2>
      <p>Lab-grown diamonds are chemically identical but cost 50-80% less:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Same 4Cs grading system</li>
        <li>Visually identical</li>
        <li>Lower resale value</li>
        <li>Ethical/environmental appeal</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Selling Your Diamonds</h2>
      <p>When selling, expect to receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>30-50% of retail for typical diamonds</li>
        <li>Higher for exceptional stones with GIA certs</li>
        <li>Certification significantly improves offers</li>
        <li>Auction houses best for high-value pieces</li>
      </ul>
