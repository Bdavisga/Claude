# Troubleshooting: calgeo.app Showing GoDaddy Landing Page

## Problem
Domain shows GoDaddy parking/landing page instead of CalGeo app.

## Root Cause
Either wrong DNS records OR domain forwarding is enabled.

---

## Solution 1: Fix DNS Records in GoDaddy

### Step 1: Check Current DNS Records
1. Go to: https://account.godaddy.com/products
2. Find **calgeo.app**
3. Click three dots (...) → **Manage DNS**
4. Scroll to **DNS Records** section

### Step 2: Verify A Record
Look for a record with **Name: @**

**If you see this (WRONG):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 184.168.221.96 (or similar GoDaddy IP)
```
**Fix:** Delete it, then add new one with Vercel's IP

**If you see this (CORRECT):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21 (Vercel's IP)
```
**Good!** Move to next step.

### Step 3: Get Correct Vercel IP
The IP might NOT be 76.76.21.21. Let's get the exact one:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/marketsavages-projects/calgeo/settings/domains
2. Find **calgeo.app** in the list
3. Look for the DNS instructions - it will show the exact IP
4. **Write down this IP address**

### Step 4: Update A Record in GoDaddy
1. In GoDaddy DNS settings, find the A record with Name: @
2. Click the **pencil/edit icon**
3. Change Value to the exact IP Vercel showed
4. TTL: 1 Hour
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS to update

## Solution 2: Disable Domain Forwarding

GoDaddy might have domain forwarding enabled.

### Check Domain Forwarding:
1. Go to: https://account.godaddy.com/products
2. Find **calgeo.app**
3. Look for "Forwarding" section
4. If you see "Forward to: [some URL]" - that's the problem!

### Disable Forwarding:
1. Click **Manage** next to Forwarding
2. Click **Delete** or **Disable**
3. Confirm

## Solution 3: Check Vercel Domain Status

### Verify Domain in Vercel:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/marketsavages-projects/calgeo/settings/domains
2. Find **calgeo.app**
3. Check the status:

**If you see:**
- ✅ **Valid Configuration** (green checkmark) - Good!
- ⚠️ **Invalid Configuration** - DNS records wrong
- ⏳ **Pending Verification** - DNS not propagated yet

### If Invalid or Pending:
1. Click on **calgeo.app** in the domains list
2. Vercel will show you exactly what DNS records to add
3. Compare with your GoDaddy settings
4. Make sure they match exactly

## Solution 4: Clear DNS Cache

Sometimes your computer or network is caching the old DNS.

### Test from Different Location:
- Try on your phone (using cellular data, not WiFi)
- Try from: https://dnschecker.org/
  - Enter: calgeo.app
  - Should show: 76.76.21.21 (or Vercel's IP)

### Clear Your DNS Cache:

**On Mac:**
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**In Browser:**
- Chrome: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
- Or try in Incognito/Private mode

## Solution 5: Redeploy in Vercel

After fixing DNS:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/marketsavages-projects/calgeo
2. Click **Deployments** tab
3. Find latest deployment
4. Click **"..."** → **Redeploy**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

### In GoDaddy:
- [ ] A record with Name: @ points to Vercel's IP (NOT GoDaddy's IP)
- [ ] No domain forwarding enabled
- [ ] No "parked" status on the domain
- [ ] DNS records saved and active

### In Vercel:
- [ ] calgeo.app is added to Domains
- [ ] Status shows ✅ Valid Configuration
- [ ] SSL certificate is active (shows padlock icon)
- [ ] All 11 environment variables are added

## Still Not Working?

If calgeo.app still shows GoDaddy landing page after trying all above:

1. **Take screenshots of:**
   - GoDaddy DNS records page (showing all records)
   - Vercel Domains page (showing calgeo.app status)
   - What dnschecker.org shows for calgeo.app

2. **Share these details:**
   - What IP address does the A record point to?
   - What does Vercel say the IP should be?
   - What does dnschecker.org show?
   - Does it work on cellular data vs WiFi?

## Expected Timeline

After fixing DNS records:
- **DNS propagation:** 5-30 minutes
- **SSL certificate:** Auto-generated by Vercel after DNS is valid
- **Domain live:** Within 30 minutes of fixing DNS
